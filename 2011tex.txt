As he looks toward the future, Scavsalot dreams of a sustainable source of armor, so craft him a chain-mail coif made from recycled pop-can tabs. Ye olde teeny-tiny coif is moste unacceptable; each headpiece must be worn by a knightly human model. [50 points]

Returning to the car, Dr. Evermor assists in the indescribably gory delivery of her human-alien hybrid baby, while Small Paul fends off the lookie-loos.

20.	I yearn for a simpler time, when LED-lit sneakers and bright patterns kept me from getting lost in the mall, when dressing for school was as simple as fastening Velcro and snapping elastic bands. But now that I’m older, I have weddings and graduations to attend, and a higher standard of dress is expected. Make me an outfit suitable for my grown-up lifestyle, featuring the toddler aesthetics that I don’t want to leave behind. [12 points] 
21.	
Augustus Scavvie was a little boy
Who thought that everything was a toy:
Glue guns, glitter, hammers, and nails,
Dry ice sitting in big white pails. 
! 
When Scav Hunt came, he saw the List
And after reading, got the gist
Of items involving dare and spunk, 
Of items made of nought but junk. 
! 
He decided he should try his hand
And join one of the merry bands,
But there it was the dreadful Fate
Befell him, which you’ll now relate…
! 
Today it is your job, my friend
To spin a yarn from start to end.
Now, Belloc’s poems were cruel and torrid—
Weave a Scav poem just as horrid. [4 points]
! 
22.	The Cabinet must have made a wrong turn near the Owatonna airport, for they have reached the End Times. The Prince of Peace is back, and he’s pissed off!  While everyone cowers in fear of this magnificent god-beast, Dr. Evermor rolls his eyes and refuses to leave the car. [8 points] 
23.	Take a picture of a Chicago intersection using tilt-shift photography. Create the corresponding miniature model. [17 points] 
24.	In Mt. Horeb, Dr. Evermor receives the Key to the City, while Large Marge makes friends with a nice lady-troll. Small Paul attempts to relieve another of his burden, and Frown Clown ignores Wavin’ Walton. [8 points] 
25.	A lava lamp fondue pot—both the interstitial fluid and the gooey “lava” must be edible and delicious. [9 points] 
26.	Lewis and Clark came back with an herbarium of almost 300 samples from the American West; we’re asking for only 10, drawn from plant species which are engraved or painted on campus buildings. The nomenclature and notations don’t have be written in quill, but the herbarium should be aesthetically and botanically pleasing. [10 points] 
27.	A simple loaf of bread made with flour, water, and Yeats. [2 points] 
28.	Dr. Evermor observes the supercranial luminescence of Beloit’s most angelic terrapin. [3 points] 
29.	Coubertin’s vision of the Olympics depended not just on athletic prowess but also on symbolism and the hope for a better world. This year, we celebrate his vision with the Scav Olympics Opening Ceremony. Teams members and athletes should gather at Hull Gate at 11 a.m. to line up for the procession. Each team should have a team flag to honor unity, a dove coffin to honor those birds of ’88, a marching routine to honor mechanical resonance, a representative from the aboriginal Scav tribe to honor our heritage, and an unyielding belief in American exceptionalism. Because the whole point of the Olympics is to show how we’re the best anyway. [20 points]
30.	The Rothsay Prairie Chicken booms for Marge and Marge alone; feelin’ saucy, Small Paul booms back. [6 points] 
31.	Celebrating holiday meals one at a time is inefficient when you could combine them, yielding delicacies such as green matzo ball soup or Bûche de Noël stuffed with black-eyed peas. Present us with a single dish that adequately acknowledges the four holidays of Scav: Cinco de Mayo, Space Day, National Scrapbook Day, and Mother’s Day. [10 points] 
32.	Someone with multiple University of Chicago degrees and the diplomas to prove it. [ points] 
33.	Frown Clown is all smiles at the International Clown Hall of Fame in Baraboo!  After reuniting with his long-lost brother, Happy the Clown, he seals the deal with the gesture that says it all.

35.	150 years ago this spring, Southern states began to secede from the United States after shots were fired at Fort Sumter. Today, there are rumors that one of our neighboring states—Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Iowa, or Wisconsin—will soon do the very same thing. Each has its own band of secessionist rabble-rousers, each with their own grievances, but only one is angry and armed enough to start a war. For us to stop them, we’ll need you tell us which state is really about to secede, who is leading the charge, and what its grievance is. Time and accuracy are essential. 
We’re giving you everything we have on these secessionist groups on our website: http://scavhunt.uchicago.edu/sumter
The information we give you is cryptic, but it is genuine. Don’t bother with Wikipedia or the mass media: they have been infiltrated and are full of lies.

38.	Scav Hunt can be dangerous. Beyond the obvious risks of power tool injury, kidnapping, chikan, hot glue burns, and electrocution, one can never rule out food poisoning, sudden loud sounds, and elevator doors. To make Scav just a little bit safer, we expect your headquarters to be decked with at least five Japanese-style public safety signs warning of the dangers of the Hunt. One can’t be expected to take risks seriously without adorable characters to personify the danger, the endangered, or accompanying helpless bystanders. [5 points] 
39.	Bring your Crayolas.5exTM for a coloring contest. We’ll expect realism, so you’d better bring lots of colors and know them well. Meet on Thursday in Hutch—we’ll be starting at 5:30 p.m. to catch the best late-afternoon light. [20 points] 
40.	Affix a pair of appropriately enormous googly eyes to the campus building of your choice. [8 points]

42.	On the outskirts of Mt. Horeb, Large Marge coos at the turtle brood but is unsettled by the strange, foreboding aura about them. Dr. Evermor documents the Parts Man, while Small Paul fends off the dimetrodon. Frown Clown, who hates everything, refuses to leave the car. [8 points]

What landmark does the Viking ship pass in front of during the film, causing Marge’s Norwegian-American pride to suddenly swell?  [11 points] 
51.	A basketball hoop that’s a rib cage. A RIB CAGE!  [12 points]

59.	One of the Captain Crunch whistles made famous by John Draper. [20 points]

61.	Dr. Evermor observes the motions of the planets and concludes that Lake Superior is indeed superior. [3 points] 
62.	Ye Gods!  By Thursday morning, your team Captains reveal themselves as the living incarnations of the Egyptian pantheon. Typical hallmarks of godhood include authentic dress (giving deference to local decency laws and the weather), animalistic features, implements symbolizing authority, and
complete devotion from your followers. [

63.	A complete copy of A Fragment Out Of Time. [25 points] 
64.	Large Marge feels an unexplainable urge to stop at Space Aliens Grill and Bar. Dr. Evermor and the Cabinet are amused by Robbie the Robot, the hippie alien, an alien autopsy, and something found three miles north of Fargo. [8 points]

69.	In 1877, a terrible plague befell Minnesota. A black cloud of grasshoppers descended upon the land, destroying the crops and consuming every leaf on every tree. One night, in a fit of prayer, the inhabitants called upon the Lord to defeat this enemy, and Lo!  He smote them down with a great frost. The Death-To-All-Grasshoppers Chapel commemorates this triumph. Dr. Evermor looks at the Stations of the Cross, believing them to be portals to another world. Large Marge, ever the investigator, examines the guestbook and brochures. [9 points, 3 bonus points] 
70.	All those public signs ending in “Richard M. Daley Mayor” just look wrong now. Bring me a sign for the Rahm Emanuel city I know and love. [40 points]

82.	Bake!  Build!  As fast as you can. An autonomous, sprinting gingerbread man. [18 points]
83.	The rest of Scav may be in da Nile, but ScavenFeast 2011 is all ’merican. Start us off with a dish that contradicts the stereotypes of both the fat American and the wasteful American by transforming skin and bones into a tantalizing appetizer. For the main course, we’re feeling rather saucy, so you will have a choice between celebrating National Barbecue Month or the mole of our neighbors (and fellow norteamericanos) to the South. And speaking of getting sauced, we all love ice cream, but these days, we prefer Jimmy’s to jimmies. Make us feel naughty and nice with boozy ice cream based on an alcoholic beverage. Finally, the interplay of flavors is one of the great marks of an excellent meal: delight our palates with one non-alcoholic drink that pairs with a course of your choice. Dinner will 
be at 7:00 p.m. on Saturday in eX Libris. Git ’er done!  [

90.	Use a skyhook to lift an object weighing at least a half pound at least six inches into the air.

100.	I’m tired of Christian indoctrination in my string games. The Manger?  Jacob’s ladder?  This is discrimination. Develop a series of string figures for Satanism that ends with the terrifying visage of our Dark Lord. [6.66 points] 
101.	An ice puppeteer with an ice puppet. [15 points] 
102.	Traditional Halloween pumpkin carving marks the summer’s end with images of death and terror cut into a hollow carapace.

103.	I don’t like most perfumes, colognes and so on, but it occurred to me recently that this might just be because they don’t smell like things I like. I mean, sandalwood?  When was the last time you saw that?  Hint: it’s not an erection in a shoe. But what if they smelled like things I actually enjoy, like frying onions or musty books?  Adorn yourself with your favorite scent, and bring me a sample for my own collection. [8 points] 
104.	GET IN THE CAR!  WE’RE GOING TO THE MUSTARD MUSEUM!  Large Marge is unsettled by mustard’s interstellar qualities. Dr. Evermor and Small Paul sample the wares, and Frown Clown asks Amy for her least favorite. [6 points]

118.	Nothing captivates our eyes like the simple elegance of a three-ball cascade, or our ears like the twangy sounds of an acoustic guitar. A beautiful harmony of these would be a touching tribute to the recently deceased King of Rock ’n’ Soul. Perform a duet of Solomon Burke’s “Everybody Needs Somebody To Love” with guitar accompaniment, while juggling. Teammates should be standing side by side and, in the true spirit of harmony, each should contribute one arm to each half of the performance. [211 points]

120.	Last year’s Captains were but pharaohs, but through death they have ascended to godhood as well. To that end, they require an appropriate 1BR/studio for the afterlife. It should have a sarcophagus, pets or servants, royal treasures, and maybe some snacks to tide them over in the eternity to come. It’ll need four rigid walls between eight and twelve feet wide, but it won’t need a ceiling. That’s right:

152.	It’s pretty impressive how quickly the Super Bowl and World Series champs get their hats and t-shirts. How do they print them so fast?

153.	Apparently The Land Before Time existed for longer than archaeologists originally believed. Show us how long it really was around with the longest unbroken string of Land Before Time movies you can find.

To ensure that no workers’ comp claims are being ignored, the Judges will make inspections during this time. [33 points] 
164.	Beware of bees!  In the FAST Corporation’s fiberglass graveyard, Small Paul sees how he measures up to Big Boy. In a halfhearted attempt to enjoy himself, Frown Clown goes down the bear slide. Also, WHERE’S MY ELEPHANT?  [12 points]

182.	A holographic etching of your team logo, drawn by hand without the use of coherent light. [7 points] 
183.	The dark side of the gleaming steel and bright lights of modern robotics is unemployment among laborers.

193.	Animate three-dimensional characters using a strobelight. If Studio Ghibli and Pixar could do it, then so can you!

[225 points] †

You’ll want to be easy on the eyes, with a nice pastel suit, perfect hair, and some quality crooner tunes. Since a concert is no fun without an audience, be sure your lounge act performs at a time when the hallways and elevators are well-populated. [13 Wayne Newton points]
