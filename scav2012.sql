Also, my experience from competing in the scav feasts in the past is that the most successful dishes are ones that are creative but not too unusual (I don\'t know if all the judges would be up for eating tongue, for example), and are based on cooking techniques/specific dishes that you have a lot of experience making (aka, not taking risks in areas you don\'t have to/making things that you know from experience will taste awesome).\r\n\r\nI don\'t know what else you guys have been thinking about making, but my inclination is to cook with bison (not listed on that Wikipedia page, but I did some research and confirmed that bison were in N.

I\'m guessing they mean both Native American and modern American cooking is off limits. I just read that the European bison (similar but not the same as the American bison we eat here) was present throughout almost all of Europe, so perhaps just to be safe, we should eliminate European nationalities from the main course as well (even though technically it\'s a different species)? But you\'re right about the &quot;flavors of home&quot; thing...Hmm. It\'s confusing that it seems to conflict with the part where they say it can be prepared in &quot;any style not indigenous to the beast&acirc;€™s home continent.&quot; I\'m not sure...\r\n\r\nAnyways, if it is non-European, we could do an Indian bison curry (since curry is basically a braise and will stay moist and hot, this would be a good preparation for the feast), and this might be impressive for the judges, since not a lot of people make Indian food at home (mmm....bison vindaloo). I don\'t know a whole lot about East Asian cooking, but I imagine there might be some kind of Asian braise or slow roast/barbeque preparation that would work well too. What do you think? \r\n\r\nAlso, I made a quick list of ingredients we could use in the dessert, as well as common dessert ingredients that we need to avoid!\r\n\r\nYES: agave, amaranth, arrowroot, barley, black raspberry, blueberry, cashew, cranberry, cocoa, guava, huckleberry, maize/corn (including cornstarch), maple syrup, tapioca, papaya, passionfruit, peanut, pecan, pineapple, quinoa, strawberry, vanilla, walnuts, goat milk\r\n\r\nNO:  butter, cows milk and cream, wheat flour (all purpose flour, etc), citrus\r\n\r\nSince there are so many yummy fruits on this list, we could try to do some kind of tropical fruit pudding (papaya seems to be a popular option on the internet) with a cashew brittle/praline and/or dark chocolate incorporated somehow? (Anything baked seems pretty risky, since we can\'t use wheat flour or butter. I love whole grains as much as the next person, but stuff baked only with amaranth, quinoa, and barley flour doesn\'t usually taste or look very good.) If we go the pudding/parfait (we could use goat\'s milk yogurt, which is pretty widely available these days) route, it would be easy to make a cute presentation using small clear plastic cups. I remember in years past that the judges really like beautiful and clean presentations, so we should definitely keep that in mind. \r\n\r\nThis is going to be awesome! Yay!

This isn\'t going to happen.\r\n\r\nIf they think we\'re giving them lip service on a technicality, we\'ll get 0 points and on this list 14 points is nothing to sneeze at. Since this is a technically a fake (I\'m not actually doing a signing) it needs to be a really *good* fake. That means it has to be a library or bookstore. I think my new fanshy phone can take care of our technical needs. We\'ll shoot for:\r\n- A photo with me, the proprietor, and the signed scavvy.\r\n- A video of the moment of signing, ideally with some passerby exclaiming &quot;what the hell?&quot;\r\n- I have three published books convenient: a self-published novel in stock at Quimby\'s, and two other literary magazine. The Scavvy to-be-signed can purchase one of each, and then I will sign the books, write a receipt, and then donate the money back to gash to reimburse Scavvy.\r\n\r\nI think if we do it this way it would be hard for any judge not to give us at least 10 or so points, and it might be good for the full 14.\r\n- As soon as I get confirmation from Liz, I\'ll &quot;promote&quot; my signing on Facebook.',NULL,1336719820,NULL,NULL),(3926,'items','115.00',244,'The definition of &quot;free-standing&quot; given would allow for things being tied to tree-branches.

Thus this is a lower bound.\r\nIn [16]: S = W*4 + 4*(W - A*4)\r\nOut[16]: 24.249123284242458\r\n\r\n# Probability that 16 new word-candidates in a cube are valid words\r\nIn [24]: 16*(W - A*4)\r\nOut[24]: -101.91582441203005\r\n\r\nThus there are &gt; 2^25 valid word squares, massively violating our assumption that the number of valid (n+1)-forms should be less than the number of valid n-forms. We conceivably could explore the entire space of 2^50 word combinations (probably in a few days on my supercomputer in MN), and obtain every valid word square (all ~20 million or so). However, there is no way we could explore all 2^(4*S) ~ 2^100 possible word cubes. Worse, the last line above shows that the number of word cubes is likely to be small, so you need to test a large fraction of that space to find one.\r\n\r\nThe same line of reasoning will, incidentally, show that it is overwhelmingly unlikely that a valid word 4-cube exists at all. So if one does, that means that letter frequency considerations must drastically *increase* the number of word squares, making this bottom-up approach even harder.\r\n\r\nSo now I\'m even more curious about the solution to this.

lacking active ingredients have caused homeopathy to be described as pseudoscience, quackery, and a &quot;cruel deception&quot;. homeopathic remedies are safe at high dilutions recommended by
