5.	Make a plasma ball out of a Mason jar. [40 points] 
6.	If you want to stay on the scene like a Sex Machine, you'd better come equipped with his weapon of choice-only it fires Buncha Crunch buckshot. [10 points]

29.	Whether it be wine, beer, or spirits, I am told there is a perfect drink for every occasion. That's great news because I'm looking for a non-alcoholic beverage that would be just right for someone who has swum, run, and biked their way from Havana to Miami. [7 points]
30.	A certificate of stock older than you. [ points] 
31.	A collegiate or professional sports team's pre-game video introduction even more extreme than that of the 2007-08 UAF Nanooks. Note: The pre-game video introduction for the 2009-10 UAF Nanooks, though clearly satisfying the requirements of this item, will not earn you any points. [12 points] 
32.	Follow in the footsteps of Ralph Walbro Emerson and Henry David Thobreau: write us some transcendentalist broetry or brose. [8 points]
33.	 
O CAPTAINS!  my Captains!  your fearful trip begun; 
The teams have weather'd List Release, the List you sought was won;
The clues are strange, Judges deranged, the people all exulting,
Yet wonder rocks your steady keel: just what will you be wearing?

50.	Floriography, motherfucker-do you speak it?  A Judge will make his feelings known to you on Thursday, but as a direct public response would be ever-so-gauche, reply with tussie-mussies at the Masque on Friday. Should your response properly charm, you should contact him further through hanakotoba at Judgment. [14 points on Friday, 16 points at Judgment] 
51.	A pi?ata that, when cracked open, disgorges a litter of unborn baby pi?atas. Within the fetal pi?atas?  Broken dreams...and candy!  [27 points]

59.	Some Ivy League schools, like Harvard and Penn, have a statue of their founder in a prominent location on campus.

60.	What was the most beautiful act of Baffles the Flower King?  [4 points]
61.	Even the ghastliest maws deserve a nice dinner every now and then. At 7 pm on Saturday, eX Libris will be host to an exquisite repast prepared by your most talented chefs. The meal will begin with an exercise in preservation that would make Ma Ingalls squirm with barely-restrained Pioneer glee. In preparing the components of your appetizer, you should employ at least two of the following techniques: smoking, pickling, or sugaring. The entree will feature a secret ingredient, the identity of which will be revealed at Captains' Phantasmagoria. Finally, we Judges have been looking a bit scrawny lately, so your dessert should be lip-smackingly loaded with at least four distinct protein-rich ingredients to beef us up for beach season. [x points] 
62.	Around the corner from the Magicians' Lair, the Macabre Mob stares in confusion at J.C. rappin' with Cousin Itt and the youth. [5 points]

68.	To understand how Mr. Chicken died, you have to understand how Mr. Chicken lived. After losing his legs to frostbite, he was outfitted with prosthetics by a kindly veterinarian.

The Accidental Mummy wonders, "Where do the clucks go? " [8 points] 
69.	An orange "Chicago 2016 Countdown" shirt from Daley Plaza. [5 points] 
70.	Proof that you have partied with Party Steve. [4 points]
71.	Where do the bucks go?  The Accidental Mummy is delighted by the White Tail Hall of Fame. Vince reaches out, longing to touch the antlers, Skeletor nods approvingly at the sled built by German POWs, and Mikey Jackson finds something oddly familiar in how the "live" deer shuffle toward him. [9 points] 
72.	Bring me a magazine that can satisfy my curiosity about Todd Stroger's general well-being and teach me how to make a mean orange crab salad. But it better cost under $25,000!  [24.999 points]
73.	Attention all arch-welders with arc welders!  Summoning all soot-saturated steam-smiths!  Grab hold of your monocles, for I hereby commission an Engine of Industry!  This mechanical marvel must harness the peerless power of hot water vapour in rolling locomotion throughout my poorly-designed coal mine, where the shafts are about 12 inches wide and allow passage of nothing longer than 18 inches, for I am an eccentric millionaire. You may select your own materials, so long as you esteemed engineers ensure each Engine embodies endless endurance, encapsulating the eternal essence of our exciting era. [100 points] ? 
74.	A roentgenogram depicting the ingestion or insertion of something that will gross us out or make us giggle, dated pre-Scav 2010. If you give me anything less than the real film you'll require such an X-ray after Judgment. [13 points]

Craft a thoughtfully artistic, yet still scavvly commemorative cake, and it better be purdy enough to be featured as a Cakewrecks Scavday Sweet. Under Neat That: submit a photo of your Wreck by Friday at 10 pm to mywreck@cakewrecks.com, and we'll let Jen pick the one destined for internet fame.

80.	Vegemite iSnack 2.0.5exTM. [8.0 cheesypoints] 
81.	True composers seek art in the everyday and inspiration in the sounds of their surroundings. Since my everyday is the Internet, and my surroundings pretty much only the mid- to late-'90s, I'll need you to write and perform an operatic aria to the tune of that godawful dial-up internet sound. [14.4 points] 
82.	Alright, nerds, time to get your trivia on. It's a Simpsons, Star Wars, and firefly trivia contest!  Send up to two trivia experts to the Reynolds Club South Lounge on Thursday at 3 pm, and we'll see whose brains are properly geeked. [s points] 
83.	Gargoyle Nutz.5exTM: The Ultimate Gargoyle Accessory. Perfect for gargoyles, sculptures, busts, even grotesques!  Ensure that your team's pendulous pair hangs visibly somewhere on campus for the duration of the Hunt. [3 points] 
84.	Balloon animals are for those clowns in the social sciences!  I want a balloon protein, one that both represents your chosen protein's tertiary/quaternary structure and actively demonstrates its native function.

85.	Snap a picture of the Boo Crew underneath the world's largest pulley. [6 points] 
86.	You Found The Secret Drawer!  [4 points]

90.	TBA 
91.	Darkness falls across the land, though the hour of dawn is already at hand, and creatures ride in search of blood, to terrorize y'alls neighborhood. At 8:00 am on Thursday in front of the Reynolds Club, the Macabre Mob convenes to begin their journey toward the eerie East and seek out its most shuddersome sights. The mustachioed impresario Vincent Price is accompanied by his three traveling terrors: Michael "Thriller" Jackson, the zombie King of Pop; Skeletor, the warlock tyrant of Eternia; and The Accidental Mummy, a clumsy corpse straight out of his snakebit sarcophagus. No car costume will be required, but we do expect to see an appropriately hair-raising ornament hanging from the rear-view mirror. [z points] 
92.	An abstract statue that casts a shadow of your team logo at noon on Judgment Sunday. [75 points] ?
93.	While inflating a flat tire along I-94, Skeletor accidentally enlarges it to world-record size. [6 points]

95.	A Dr. Jekyll of Hyde Park. [7 points]
96.	I've always wondered what it's like to be a kitten being petted. They seem so happy and content. I've tried having friends and even strangers stroke my back, but it's just not the same. Maybe that's because for a kitten, the hand petting it is as big as its entire body... [20 points] 
97.	I've always wanted to be small enough to play on a cat tree. But I think that, all along, what I really wanted was a human tree... [50 points] 
98.	CondomMents-give her a pickle she can really relish. [3 points]
99.	Koalas aren't bears, so why do we call them koala bears?  Why don't we call them koala monsters, like the gila monster, or Cookie Monster?  Someone should really get on this. [14 points]

106.	Internaut Ice Cream. [6 points] 
107.	In 1907, a chance association with the Ashtabula Horror was enough to transfigure Case Western Reserve University into a depraved perversion of the U-.2667em .5exo-.125em.4exf-.125em C campus. From the steps of the Bizarro Reynolds Club, formerly Amasa Stone Chapel, the Phantasmal Four stare in confusion at Bizzaro Pierce and Bizarro Rockefeller. Inside, an informative pamphlet explains why they're standing in something of a deathly hallow. [9 points] 
108.	In 1908, drawn to Case Western's strange energies, a dark power took roost in the Law School. In an attempt to curry favor, Skeletor prepares The Accidental Mummy for sacrifice atop the low ziggurat across the street, Vincent Price summons unholy spirits within "Turning Points" (1996), and Michael "Thriller" Jackson gives a performance inside a non-Euclidean bandshell. 
109.	By 1909, our fragile world could no longer contain the eldritch forces at work in Case Western Reserve. A transdimensional portal opened up next to one of the Dark One's putrid towers. The town elders came together to bravely seal the rift, renaming the city 'Cleave-Land' and rededicating the portal as the Cancer Survivor's Memorial Plaza. Thriller J hugs the poor girl still trapped in the portal, frozen for all time. [7 points] 
110.	The stuff dreams are made of. Do not conflate with item . [7 points]
111.	Near the southern corner of the Ashtabula County Medical Center, the Macabre Mob finds a marker commemorating the Ashtabula Horror. [5 points] 
112.	According to the audio guide in the garden in front of the Ashtabula County Medical Center, water wouldn't have helped put out the fires of the Ashtabula Horror But what could it have done?  Why did one Wisconsin woman brace herself?  What did Engine No. 1's headlights eerily illuminate?  [10 points]
113.	Christian Louboutins might scream sexy, but I want shoes that literally scream sexy with each step. [14 points]
114.	I've been working on a new product that's designed to give you and other men new confidence!  I'm talking about my new pubic hair stencils for men. Just shave one of my stylish designs into your pubic hair and watch the ladies become intrigued!  While some chicks might go for a simple downward-pointing arrow, classy broads want an artiste who can transform his jungle into an intricate topiary. [V points] 
115.	The Choco Taco deceived me into thinking my icy treat would contain all the flavors of Estados Unidos Mexicanos when all it really contained was sweet, creamy disappointment. Less choco, more taco!  Bring me a waffle taco shell filled with scoops of ice cream for each major element-beans, meat, and all. [Diecisiete puntos] 
116.	Get your toes done up with your fingernails matchin'. Time to get yo' nails did with some Chicago-themed stereoscopic nail art. [10 points]
117.	An illustrated Canadian Kama Sutra. One act per province. But nothing from the territories, you pervert. [18 points] 
118.	Unboil an egg. [One dozen points]
119.	When I was a child, I doodled in ChemDraw, arranging p-orbitals into delicate butterflies. As I have grown, so have my skills at connecting carbon atoms like dots to form a microscopic view of life. But my tastes have also grown, and I want something more than daisies-I want to see a biological metamorphosis on a more macroscopic scale, using the same microscopic medium. With the addition of a single reagent, bonds change, kids grow up, and little caterpillars turn into swallowtails. All bonding must be in proper valence. Show arrow pushing. [2+6+10+14 points] 
120.	A surgical kit. A wooden-handled chisel. Field glasses. An Underwood portable typewriter. Zinc oxide tape. Hydrochloric acid. My Blessed Little Pal. [19 points] 
121.	Irish car bombs are disgusting. Who wants a drink that curdles?  Bring me a room-temperature solid that liquifies into boozy delight with an additional shot.  [10 points] 
122.	Place a cloth napkin over your head to hide your cruelty from the sight of God. Put the whole bird into your mouth, with only the beak protruding from your lips. Bite. Put the beak on your plate and begin chewing, gently. You will taste three things: First, the sweetness of the flesh and fat. This is God. Then, the bitterness of the guts will begin to overwhelm you. This is the suffering of Jesus. Finally, as your teeth break the small, delicate bones and they begin to lacerate your gums, you will taste the salt of your own blood, mingling with the richness of the fat and the bitterness of the organs. This is the Holy Spirit, the mystery of the Trinity-three united as one. It is cruel. And beautiful. Send your bravest gastronome to the entrance of Bond Chapel at 7:45 pm on Friday with napkin in hand. [g points] 
123.	Studies have estimated that every human body contains two to five pounds of bacteria. We want just one pound, pure. [16 points]
124.	Whenever I get a gift in nested boxes, opening each diminishing box makes my hopes diminish as well. Wouldn't it be great to have my hopes increase with successive boxes, each larger than the previous?  Four box minimum. [30 points, 10 bonus points for a final gift larger than the original packaging] 
125.	You're traveling through another dimension, a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind: Binghamton, NY. In the Forum Theatre, Skeletor makes his screenplay pitch to the bust of Rod Serling. [7 points]
126.	A single emoticon which expresses the feeling upon finding out that your mother has been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, which you do not consider to be a real medical condition, though you genuinely love your mother and believe she suffers pain, but you also suspect that it is the result of a long-term opiate addiction. Up to four characters. [4 points] 
127.	Since you've got such an extraordinary head of hair, you should do something extraordinary with it. Make a Nagi Noda critter from rooted human hair. [25 points]
128.	Can't muster the hair to serve as a critter?  How about a critter to serve as hair?  A bald man wearing a toup?e which also happens to be a live mammal. Toup?es will be evaluated on realism and believability. [5 points] 
129.	Dogs Playing Dungeons and Dragons. 2010. Acrylic on velvet. Judgment Day, University of Chicago. [18 points]
130.	Scavvy's Delight!  Your team is the best above the rest, so let the world know with a music video in which your captains extol the virtues of your team and defend themselves from the allegations of other suckah MCs. Said video should be easily placed within the period between 1988 and 1996; for stylistic reference, please see such seminal works as Will Smith's "Ring My Bell", LL Cool J's "Ain't Nobody", and Naughty By Nature's "O.P.P.". [15 points]
131.	The longest possible unbroken strip of orange peel. [0.5 points per inch over 48] 
132.	At some event during the Hunt, one of your unsuspecting team members is devoured by a giant man-eating clam. After the Scavvy has disappeared completely into its horrible maw, the clam should belch loudly and produce a giant pearl. [16 points] 
133.	Look, Maria, this is ScavHunt. While I'd love to spend a whole day frolicking through the Alps with you and the von Trapp children, I simply don't have the time. You're going to have to take your Do-Re-Mi and speed it up. A lot. Start at the very beginning (a very good place to start) and perform the entire number as fast as you can, including as much of the appropriate choreography as possible-the carriage ride, skipping gaily about the fountain, step-jumping, etc. Make sure that all seven children are wearing the play-clothes you made from those tatty old curtains. All performances must be live. [1.6 points per 10 seconds under 5 minutes] 
134.	The Dickbee.5exTM is a penile plethysmograph that tweets when a penis achieves erection!  Now you can share your awkward classroom boners with family and friends around the world. Call now to purchase for just three easy payments of $29.99!  [8 points]

136.	An unopened box of Mallomars. [8 points] 
137.	Why are there so many Jedi at Celtic Fest?  Provide video evidence of the Council touring the Celtic festivities, interacting with the Celtic natives, and dealing with any Sith riff-raff that attempt to spoil their Celtic fun. [10 points] 
138.	Perform a Benihana-caliber teppanyaki routine on your antigriddle. [16 points] 
139.	The Hotdoggers are a proud people, with ambassadors, an educational system, a national anthem, and even a stance on the United States Armed Forces. Let's be frank: who doesn't wish they were one of them?  Perform an (all)natural(beef)ization ceremony in which at least three of your wiener-wannabees are made full citizens of Oscartown, making sure that each takes the oath with all the relish he or she can mustard. [12 points. 20 bonus points if the ceremony is performed by a geniuwiener ambassador of the Wiener Nation. 20 bonus points if a band of Wienerwhistles (and a lone tuba) plays the anthem as the newly condiminted citizens are driven away in one of the national limousines (make sure they take the scenic kraut). 20 bonus points if the Judges get to meat President Frank E.

143.	The Family of the Damned is probably ready to leave Ashtabula, but before they do they must visit the mass grave and memorial recognizing the unrecognizable dead of the Ashtabula Horror. To prove you were there, take a photo of your bravest team member next to the marker. [25 points]
144.	Having spent hours in the Crerar, I often have this urge to strap on a big silver fin and move slowly through the low bookcases, humming the Jaws theme song. Perhaps you share my fantasy. Lead a cartilaginous shiver to converge upon a studying student. [10 points]

151.	The Boo Crew gains their wings with a spin through the National Soaring Museum. What was the first plane sold by the Schweizers?  According to the WWII glider, when do they cheer?  Who signed the guest book on 4/24 at 2:34 pm?  [7 points] 
152.	"Food lovers and gun lovers have a ton of things in common, maybe for the food lover it's seeking out that crazy fish you kind of know you're not supposed to eat, while for the gun lover it's killing that animal that might be considered kind of borderline endangered". The gift that proves "this partnership is a no-brainer". [28 points] 
153.	Rumors of Mr. Twain's death have been mostly on the mark-until now!  Thriller J does what he does best in an attempt to raise Twain while Vincent Price narrates. [12 points, bonus points if a funky army of the damned rise from their graves to join in] 
154.	I always thought that the stories of giant foam monsters coming to reclaim their giant foam fingers were just old wives' tales meant to scare misbehaving sports fans-that is, until I saw what happened to that Scavvy cheering on the sidelines at this year's Scav Olympics. I will never claim to be #1 again. [21 points] 
155.	They say it went extinct over a century ago, but at a memorial in Elmira the Ghoulish Gang can have their photo taken with the last Labrador Duck in New York. The Accidental Mummy maintains its curiosity. [6 points]

158.	Scranton!  The Electric City!  Skeletor laughs at Christopher Columbus, who has mistaken Rite-Aid for Africa. Nearby, Action Jackson shoots his sixteen-pound load at Love in front of the Lackawanna County Courthouse. Vincent's head literally spins when he sees the bust and ashes of The Exorcist's young priest. The Accidental Mummy mourns the death of Christmas at the hands of Ukrainians in 1988. [12 points]
159.	It's hot, smelly, itchy, in your mouth and around your skull. A member of your team proudly wearing the headgear he or she had to wear as a child and the photos to prove a youth full of awkward misery. [15 points, 2 bonus points if it's your class photo] 
160.	While in Scranton, make a "that's what she said" joke, play a prank, promote yourself to assistant regional manager, and speak directly to the camera. But be quick, we have to be in the conference room in five minutes. [10 points]
161.	May 7, 2010, 10:30 pm. A foul wind tosses decayed leaves in my face with almost willful malevolence as I trudge toward the Chapel. Its soaring belltower, once proud, now seems craven, afraid of the unhallowed Mass it will soon host. The sagging gambrel roofs of the campus architectures likewise cower as we approach, their weathered walls and ruined faces a mockery of the pustules and pockmarks that cover my companions. Shunned by the campus, denied by the hospitals, we march onward, determined to revel in our grisly condition. Our masks may do little to conceal our Afflictions, but in a fit of gallows humour we have decorated them gaily, and will throw a Masque in our dying hours. Each family has appointed its most wretched specimen a Seed of Corruption, whom we venerate with savage glee; their twisted countenances defy description by even a madman such as myself. When the clock strikes midnight I expect we shall all be dead, but until then we shall dance as though to tire Death himself. [w points] 
162.	To facilitate the completion of item , have your best DJ make us a nine minute mix of gnarled and eldritch jams. We want to dance, but dance like madmen. Due by 8 pm on Friday to scavjams@gmail.com. [9 points]

165.	An elementary school class photo of every active Judge. It's Mother's Day, so don't bug our parents. [4 points per photo] 
166.	To hear the hallowed halls of learning ring again with lovely notes of harmony and praise, I expect you to sing a University of Chicago song published before 1930. Be sure to sing it at an appropriate time and place, and I don't want to hear a song that's been performed on campus in the last five years. Please bring of a copy of the sheet music so I can follow along. [12 points]

173.	I would suggest Thursday 5-8, but whenever you go, tell me where I can find a crocodile chandelier (209-219), three little lizards (202-208), two artichokes (389-399), and a stag missing its shaft (131-134) and include their acquisition numbers. [16 points] 
174.	One of your team members, at Judgment, wearing a ticket-taker's cloak from the Chicago Lyric Opera. [28 points]
175.	The Judges are so busy during the Hunt that we often miss the chance to read the papers. That's why you should bring us the best crash blossom you can find during this year's Hunt in a print newspaper with circulation in excess of 100,000. [5 points]

183.	Your headquarters are already pretty okay, but we all know that a true enclave of heroism requires one particular item: a six foot tall penny. Or are you just a cowardly and superstitious lot?  [8 points] 
184.	Start up a copy of Super Mario Brothers 3. Put the sound on mute. Your jazz quartet will be performing all the music and sound effects the Judge should need. [30 points]

186.	Social life is hard at the U-.2667em .5exo-.125em.4exf-.125em C. It's difficult to demonstrate your evolutionary fitness, even if your body structure shows you are clearly able to produce scores of offspring. However, now is that time when the Northern American Scavvy goes into heat. We Judges will be waiting in the bushes with binoculars as your plumage-bedecked hopefuls spray their pheromones, prepare a nesting ground, and perform a mating dance that would make Jack Hanna proud. [8 points] 
187.	Utilize Rabelais's favorite choice of all torcheculs, arsewisps, bumfodders, tail-napkins, bunghole cleansers, and wipe-breeches for its intended purpose. [12 points, but only if you feel in your nockhole a most wonderful pleasure]

During the judging of this page, a single Scavvy should be flashing the following rings: Class, Championship, Signet, Purity, Archery Thumb, Mood, One (to rule them all, of course), Green Lantern, -Pop.5exTM, and one containing the largest precious gem you can find. That's ten, so don't go all "The Mandarin" on us. [1 point each, 5 bonus points for all ten]
192.	Darn. With Scav going on, you forgot to do your reading for class. You're really screwed if the professor calls on you. Good thing you showed up in your ghillie suit. [18 points] 
193.	As you approach Centralia from Ashland, PA, continue on past the burnt-out building on your left. After the burnt-out building, look for Our Lady of the Wastes. You're very close now. Can you smell it?  Soon after the Madonna you'll see a clearing on your left. A plea to Governor Rendell has been posted there. Along the north edge of the clearing is a dirt road; turn up it. Go slowly. At the top of the hill, turn on your high beams and tilt your vehicle to the slope on your right. This is a land forsaken by God. This is Centralia. Film or photograph one of your team members as they clamber over the mounds of shale and feel the cursed earth-it should be clear this is no ordinary field. Then bring us back a piece of Hell. [30 points]
194.	World's Largest Hamburgers!  The Boo Crew chows down on a Pub Challenger at Denny's Beer Barrel Pub. [15 points]

198.	That is highly illegal. Wait, it's not?  Find something that can be legally purchased in Chicago, yet is so patently contrary to the general welfare as to shock the conscience of a Judge. Proof of purchase required. [15 points] 
199.	Sunshine-flavored lollipops. [3 points]
200.	By the banks of the Allegheny, a Transformer stands guard over downtown Pittsburgh. The Accidental Mummy wonders, "Where did the trucks go? " [4 points]

203.	If ScavHunt had been started in 1962, this would be our 48.5exth anniversary!  What was it like for our pre-Scav forebears?  Bring me the Hyde Park Herald from what would have been the first Judgment Sunday. [6.2 points]
204.	The genre of portraiture is an exploration of the exquisite interplay between Being and Nonbeing, showing and hiding. Indeed, it is through the selective inclusion of those flattering elements and exclusion of the inconvenient or grotesque that the ideal Self is represented, though the viewer is left to wonder about what, precisely, has been omitted. A rich conundrum, no doubt, but far too subtle for me. I prefer sculpture in the round, where I can be sure that nothing hides just outside the boundary of the canvas. Pick a portrait in Hutch and create a corresponding sculptural representation that leaves no horrible detail to the imagination, but still concords with the original portrait's depiction. [36 points] 
205.	In the Romanian classroom of the Cathedral of Learning, what are thirteen dudes giving the big J.C.?  (Hint: it's not an erection) [5 points] 
206.	A haiku, written on an upside-down calculator screen. I will read it in English, but I want you to recite it in numerical form with the staid expressiveness befitting your noble verse. [11 points]

211.	Oll raigth!  We're sure our theme song is written in English, but maybe we're just having trouble with the accent. We figure your Scavenbrains are up to the transliteration challenge, so give the original music video English subtitles. [7 pOK! OK! OK! OK! oints] 
212.	A fully working padlock, demonstrably openable, to be delivered to the Judges at 3 pm on Thursday in the Reynolds Club South Lounge. [6 points]

214.	Oh no!  One of those dastardly Judges has absconded with a jarful of your points!  At Captains' Breakfast, the only thing that will be returned to you is the jar from which they were stolen.

218.	Everyone knows the one about the Higgs boson and the clown walking into the bar, but when was the last time you heard a really good HIPS joke1 ?  Compile department-specific jokes from as many different academic departments as you can. Faculty should tell jokes about their own departments and they should be recorded on video so we can all enjoy them. [4 points per department]
219.	Bring documents proving that the notorious Prawo Jazdy is one of your team?s members. [5 points, 15 bonus points if your Mr. or Ms. Jazdy also produces a traffic ticket made out in his or her name] 
220.	Pop a balloon inside another balloon. Both balloons must have taut surfaces. Do not violate the topological integrity of the outer balloon. [18 points]
221.	A dress tailored to fit the University of Chicago's 1971 homecoming queen, to be modeled by her or a close relative at Judgment. [11 points] 
222.	Construct a functioning solid-state transistor from scratch. Shockley, Bardeen, and Brattain did it and got a Nobel Prize. If you do it, you'll get the next best thing. [38 points]

This means that you'll have more than enough time to safely pick any of the locks located in plain sight in front of the Reg, beginning at 4 pm on Thursday. [12 points per opened lock, belonging to another team, presented at Judgment] 
225.	Demonstrate Action Units 2 and 29, and while you're at it wiggle each of your ears, one at a time. [18 points]

You're at the combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell?  Be at the Pizza Hut. Be at the Taco Bell. Be at the combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. There is a Pizza Hut, there is a Taco Bell, but there is no combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell!  Be at a Pizza Hut. Be at a Taco Bell. Be there at combination Thursday night and eleven o'clock. [l points] 
228.	Spurned by the Triceratops and desperate for tail, Vincent Price tenderly caresses the languid sack of Diplodocus carnegii. "Oh, Dippy! " [3 points]

Make sure to include the vast and sparkling dome, the spacious reading room, and the deep underground cavern housing every book created by Man and the occult tomes no human can read without going mad. The troll tunnels and mole-men caves are a must, and while you're at it, include a hand-cranked model of the robotic book-fetching arm and any other details you see fit. But there's no need to electrify the metal frame-we want this model to be perfectly bird-friendly. [57 points]

255.	You know what would be cool?  If you could dance to the soundtrack of your life and your (wo)man-sized marionette twin followed your every move. You know what would be cooler?  If there were two of them...or three...or four. Let's be clear, some dude just jerking around the marionettes would be very not cool. Your movements should animate the marionettes with only the help of various ingenious mechanical contrivances, and the more sweet dance moves they can perform, the better. Also, if they made us question which of them is man and which is marionette, that'd be scrumptious. [75 points each for the first two marionettes, 50 for the third, and 25 for the fourth] ?
