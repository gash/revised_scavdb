Yet no influx of admirers thronged about her person; for reasons, if reasons they may be called, which remained obscure to me, she had neither husband nor beau of any kind. Each seventh day I watched her solitary processions back and forth from the little church in the dark glade at the end of the lane on which I then resided. I wished to speak with her, but each week when I searched within myself for courage &acirc;€“ courage, a virtue with which I was little enough acquainted, to be sure &acirc;€“ I found it not. \r\n	On this last Sunday I resolved myself to wait no longer. Rather enduring than suppressing a quiver of trepidation, I stepped out, thinking to make some excuse for detaining her. &acirc;€œE-E-E-Excuse me,&acirc;€ I stammered. &acirc;€œI have long wanted to speak with you.&acirc;€ She made to raise her gaze from the path, where it had been occupied, to my precariously composed visage.

It had been such, in fact, that I had neglected to wear any undergarments beneath them as well.

This item is now mostly finished and only awaits setup in Chicago.  I\'ve uploaded four files:\r\n\r\nGASHRATTATA.SAV is a no$gmb battery RAM file with a saved game at the start of the Elite Four.  It can be placed in the &quot;Battery&quot; folder.\r\nGASHRATTATA.SNA is a frozen no$gmb game state at the start of the Elite Four.  You can load it from the game menu.\r\n(Either one should suffice, but I\'ve included both just in case.)\r\nmaindatafile.zip contains the information no$gmb needs to run the game.\r\nno$gmb.zip contains no$gmb itself.  As a reminder, this is a PC executable.\r\n\r\nWhether you are doing it in-person or making a video, I recommend setting it (right-click to get to the settings) to the &quot;Unlimited Mhz-Disaster 50%&quot; option, which reduces the time it will take to watch this down to a minute or two instead of 5-10.  Some more suggestions:\r\n\r\n1. Take a minute to show off the pokemon before you start.  Hit &quot;START&quot; (enter) to get to the menu and choose the PKMN option to see our team of six Rattata (SCAVENCZAR, SCROLLKEEP, SIRECTOR, CGRISWOLD, PMINISTER, and VAMPIRE).  You can further use the status option to show off their stats and moves, which are unique for each pokemon and none of which involve any cheating, and which represent the full fruit of what RATTATA can achieve.  The stats are different because of the DVs.\r\n\r\nThere is an option called &quot;GASH&quot; because the trainer\'s name is set to GASH.  Note that his default name is ASH *manaical dork laughter*\r\n\r\n2. After you finish, take the few seconds to go meet the final boss as well -- I have set his name as ELIJAH.\r\n\r\n3. As far as the battles themselves: the team is level 100 and the enemies are level 40-65.  Most fights can be won in a single hit with BODY SLAM.  One important exception are the ghost-types used by the third Elite, which BODY SLAM will never damage.  Use DIG against them instead.  Against the last Elite, it may be faster to use BLIZZARD instead of BODY SLAM.  However, you have enough of an advantage in stats that you can do whatever you want and it will be hard to use.  There are also some items you can use to heal/revive pokemon if needed.','',1241913890),(2142,73,100,NULL,'Item 245: new comment','Alan and Amber are handling this!

They directed me to a few other places that either aren\'t listed online or don\'t answer their phone numbers.  After more searching: Dodge Grain Co has it, but only at their Salem, NH location.  It\'s $13 for 1 gallon or $28 for 5 gallons.  Upside: no tax in NH.  Essex County Co-Op in Topsfield, MA has it for $8.95 a gallon.  Agway sells it for $10.99 a gallon, but there is an Agway in Waltham.  How much do you think we need?  Dodge Grain is a deal if we need a lot, otherwise I\'ll pop over to Agway.','',1273246872),(2856,106,107,NULL,'Item 40: new comment','Would Dean have any?

The elves would arrive in a few hours, and it was time to make them a new butter sculpture. The workroom\'s temperature was maintained at a perfectly chilled 32 degrees Fahrenheit, exactly right for butter sculpting. Every nerve ending in Rocky\'s skin lit up with goosebumps as the air hit his body. He was wearing only a t-shirt, the better to keep his limbs. Each of the black curly hairs on his arms stood at attention, like elven arrow quivers.\r\n\r\nHe took a few moments before getting to work in order to admire the large bamboo frame that had been lovingly twisted and tied into a statue of the Elf King. Soon enough, it would be covered in 40 pounds of cold sculpted butter. This would be Rocky\'s most ambitious sculpture to date. The king would be pleased. \r\n\r\nWell, nothing to do now but get started. Rocky pulled out a five gallon bucket from a nearby storage closet, then filled it with water from the hose. He removed several ice cube trays from the workroom freezer and twisted the cubes loose into the bucket. A few cold drops of water splashed up onto his tight vinyl pants, and he shivered more. The vinyl kept the butter from melting through to his skin.\r\n\r\nHe plunged his two arms deep into the bucket of ice water. It was so bracing that it took his breath away. It didn\'t matter how many hundreds of times he had done this. It always gave him involuntary shudders throughout his body. But his hands needed to be cold to knead the butter properly. He kept his arms elbow deep in the bucket long for as he could stand it, until they felt like two cold lumps that belonged to another person\'s body. Perfect. \r\n\r\nHe cut a large chunk of butter from the huge yellow block of it in the refrigerator and began kneading it between the massive fingers of his cold hands. The kneading pushed out any airholes and yielded a thick buttery paste. Slowly, he started slathering the kneaded lumps against the bamboo frame, filling ever every crevice, pushing cold butter into every opening. He had to put his hands into the ice water several more times and feel its cold burn. But the he needed dampen the heat of his hands in order to keep the butter hard. \r\n\r\nIt took an hour of kneading and pushing to completely fill the mold with butter. Next, Rocky removed a cold stylus from the freezer and cut shape and definition into the elf king statue. Little curls of excess butter fluttered down to the floor. He used the heat from the fingertips of his left hand and the precision tool in his right hand to recreate each of the elf king\'s stately features and clothing. When his fingers grew too slippery with melted butter, he licked them clean. \r\n\r\nAt last, the butter statue was finished. He had done it; he had made the greatest butter statue of an elf king of all time. The visiting elf party would be pleased. Rocky wiped his slick hands against a towel and sighed with pleasure and satisfaction.','',1273376574),(3394,79,79,NULL,'Item 23: new comment','Status update','',1273376754),(3395,61,61,NULL,'Item 75.00: new comment','We saw the cello.

Modern homeopaths have proposed that water has a memory that allows homeopathic preparations to work without any of the original substance; however, there are no verified observations nor scientifically plausible physical mechanisms for such a phenomenon. The lack of convincing scientific evidence to support homeopathy\'s efficacy and its use of remedies lacking active ingredients have caused homeopathy to be described as pseudoscience, quackery, and a &quot;cruel deception&quot;.

lacking active ingredients have caused homeopathy to be described as pseudoscience, quackery, and a &quot;cruel deception&quot;. homeopathic remedies are safe at high dilutions recommended by
